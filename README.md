This is a repo for a quickshell UI that will be used in tandam with hyperland. I am currently running this off of Cachy os, so I imagine it would work on arch just fine. I will add more details/ improve function as I get more done in this project. Below is the order of things that I'm currently working on and how far along I am.

todo:

-Theme manager singleton  DONE

-Create functional volume popUp DONE

-Create functioning connection manager popUp DONE

-back up . files with a github repo ez DONE

-Application Launcher popUp

-display Current Application in task bar

-display system stats

-Make the timer not look completely terrible.

-power button

-calendar popup

-Shortcuts cheat sheet pop up [fun and easy quick win] (maybe we make it dynamic based on hyperland configs) 

-themeChangerPopup (should be a quick win. most of the work is already done. The only "difficult" part will be expanding themes to other applications outside of quickshell)

-transitionEffects and aesthetic tweeks
